Overview
This dataset is a subset of the Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0. 
This dataset contains movie reviews along with their associated binary
sentiment polarity labels. 

Dataset 

The core dataset contains 25k train reviews and 10K test reviews.

In the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any
given movie because reviews for the same movie tend to have correlated
ratings. Further, the train and test sets contain a disjoint set of
movies, so no significant performance is obtained by memorizing
movie-unique terms and their associated with observed labels.  

Files

There are two top-level directories [train/, test/] corresponding to
the training and test sets. Each contains [pos/, neg/] directories for
the reviews with binary labels positive and negative. Within these
directories, reviews are stored in text files named following the
convention [[id]_[rating].txt] where [id] is a unique id and [rating] is
the star rating for that review on a 1-10 scale. For example, the file
[test/pos/200_8.txt] is the text for a positive-labeled test set
example with unique id 200 and star rating 8/10 from IMDb.
